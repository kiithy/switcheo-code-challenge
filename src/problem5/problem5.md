# Task: Utility Contract
Duration: You should not spend more than 12 hours on this problem.

> Solidity Only - you are to complete this problem using Solidity.

Deploy a utility EVM contract with a function to retrieve all token balances given a wallet address and the token contract addresses.

How your contract will be tested:

`./test.js`

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const ADDR = "…";   // your contract address
const ABI = […];    // your contract ABI

const ADDRESS = "…"; // some wallet address with token balance
const TOKENS = [    // token contract addresses
	"…",
	"…",
];

// you can use your own RPC provider url (no need to deploy to mainnet)
const provider = ethers.providers.getDefaultProvider();

const test = async () => {
	const contract = new ethers.Contract(ADDR, ABI, provider);

  const balances = await contract.getBalances(ADDRESS, tokens);

	return balances;
};

test().then(console.log);
```

## Expected Output
The output should be organized as one token amount per object.

```json
[
  {
    token: "0x123d475e13aa54a43a7421d94caa4459da021c77",
    balance: "9988887462734227" // its okay if this is typed ethers.BigNumber
  },
  {
    token: "0x55f6823de9642f47e80ed4845a55aa8430cb4ec6",
    balance: "899998285714286"
  },
  …
]
```
