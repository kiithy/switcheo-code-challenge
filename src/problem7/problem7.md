# Task

Tables:

`balances`

| id | address | denom | amount | block_height |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0xabab.. | usdc | 50000000000000 | 733755 |
| 2 | 0x99cc.. | swth | -20000000 | 733757 |
| 3 | 0xabab.. | usdc | -50000000000 | 733855 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Each row in the `balances` table records the balance change. e.g. if address `0x99cc..` account is being deducted by `20000000swth`, it will be represented as row id=2.

A denom is akin to currency.

`trades`

| id | address | denom | amount | block_height |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0xabab.. | swth | 400000000000 | 733756 |
| 2 | 0x99cc.. | usdc | 3500000000000 | 733757 |
| 3 | 0x67f3.. | swth | 72000000000000 | 733758 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Each row in the `trades` table records the trade information. e.g. if address `0x99cc..` made a trade of `3500000000000usdc`, it will be represented as row id=2.

Write an SQL query that returns the the list of addresses which has recently made a trade, and wallet has at least $500 (total balance) in it.


> ⚠️ Note: there may be more than one row per address in each of the `trades` and `balances` tables.
>i.e. user made more than 1 trade, or have more than 1 change in their balance over time.



Constraints:

1. Recently made a trade means block_height strictly greater than 730000.
2. There is a total of 3 denoms.
    1. usdc is worth $0.000001
    2. swth is worth $0.00000005
    3. tmz is worth $0.003
3. Note that the usd values of the denoms changes frequently and we want to compute the usd value of the wallet on the fly without storing them into a table.

Note:

1. You are recommended to use PostgreSQL because that is what we are using. However, feel free to use a language you are more familiar with.
2. You’re not supposed to write a function/procedure, the solution should be entirely implemented in one query statement.
